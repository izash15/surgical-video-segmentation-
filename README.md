Expert Branches: Module Diversity for Stronger Feature Learning in Laparoscopic Segmentation
This AI capstone done at SLU in 2026 focuses on further building ont the tri-path expert branch research mdoel that was developed by Lin __ under the supervisor of Flavio Esposito. We seek to increase the diversity of the paths by integrating a vision transformer as another expert branch within this model, to see if we can increase the accuracy of single organ recognition in the segmentation of surgical images such as those used in the da-vinci laproscopic imaging. 


1.2. Problem Definition & Scoping
1. Clearly define the AI problem (task, inputs, outputs, constraints).
This project extends the pre-built supervised tri-path expert branch code. We work with the __  dataset as our input and return expected mask with is then evaluated on 4 metrics (_ _ _ _). We use these metrics for __. 

2. Specify whether the task is:
• Supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement learning
• Classification, regression, detection, generation, or decision-making
3. Identify evaluation metrics and justify their choice.
4. Document assumptions, limitations, and ethical considerations.

1.3. Data Management
1. Document data sources and licenses.
2. Include scripts for data preprocessing and cleaning.
3. Ensure raw data is never modified in place.
4. If data cannot be shared, provide:
• A clear description of the dataset
• Instructions to obtain or regenerate it
