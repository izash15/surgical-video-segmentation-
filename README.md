Expert Branches: Module Diversity for Stronger Feature Learning in Laparoscopic Segmentation

- from Flavio required docs
Add a README.md describing:
• Project title and motivation
• Problem statement
• Dataset(s) - you can update this later
• Expected deliverables


1.2. Problem Definition & Scoping
1. Clearly define the AI problem (task, inputs, outputs, constraints).
2. Specify whether the task is:
• Supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised, or reinforcement learning
• Classification, regression, detection, generation, or decision-making
3. Identify evaluation metrics and justify their choice.
4. Document assumptions, limitations, and ethical considerations.

1.3. Data Management
1. Document data sources and licenses.
2. Include scripts for data preprocessing and cleaning.
3. Ensure raw data is never modified in place.
4. If data cannot be shared, provide:
• A clear description of the dataset
• Instructions to obtain or regenerate it
